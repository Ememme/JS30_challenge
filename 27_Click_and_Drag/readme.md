# What I've learned

## CSS

### box-shadow 
*inset*

If not specified (default), the shadow is a drop shadow (the box raised above the content).
Inset keyword changes the shadow to one inside the frame (the content was depressed inside the box). 
Inset shadows are drawn inside the border (even transparent ones), above the background, but below content.


## JS

console.count(): insted of logging every single event, gives a summary of how many times sth occured.

## element.scrollLeft 

`scrollLeft` property gets or sets the number of pixels that an element's content is scrolled from its left edge.

If the element's direction is rtl (right-to-left), scrollLeft is 0 when the scrollbar is at its rightmost position (at the start of the scrolled content), 

## pageX
The MouseEvent.pageX read-only property returns the horizontal coordinate of the event relative to the whole document.
